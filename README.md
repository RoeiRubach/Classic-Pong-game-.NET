Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games. It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensinal graphics.

## Final year project

This project was for my first year final project.
We had different options between which project to choose, I guess I was choosing Pong because it felt the right one for me.

## Build status

The game currently has 2 out of 3 options:
- [x] 1 Player.
- [ ] 2 Players.
- [x] High score.

Will update when the new feature will be ready.
